This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in Elixir string processing and its solution.  The `StringCalculator` module attempts to add numbers from a comma-separated string.  The bug lies in its lack of error handling for edge cases like empty strings and non-numeric input. The solution demonstrates robust handling of these scenarios, showcasing best practices for error prevention in Elixir.
